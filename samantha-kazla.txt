Create YOUR OWN version of Repo ---> (Fork)

Add your TL as collaborator

on GitHub:
Settings -> Collaborators -> Add Collaborator (use your TL's handle)
(I'd suggest grabbing the invite tag and DM it to your TL on Slack at this point)

Clone YOUR Repo

back on your machine:
git clone <your-repo-address>

Create a branch (the one you are going to be working on)

cd <repo directory>
git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'

Push your new branch up to GitHub and make all future pushes to that branch

git push -u origin firstname-lastname

on GitHub:
Compare & Pull Request -> Base: YOUR MASTER (Not the Lambda Master)
compare fork: YOUR FORK

Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull Request

On the 'Open a Pull Request' page click on Reviewers. If your TL has accepted your invite, then you should be able to select them here. If not, then they haven't accepted the invite, and come back later...

Your TL will merge the work into YOUR Master fork when they have reviewed and approved it.



Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element’s content, inside of any defined margins and/or borders.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
<nav> <footer> <p>, <a> <span>, <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.  It needs width, padding, border and margin.
